# The Symbol Table

Please consult the [CS331 web page](http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~cs331/symbol_table/symbol_table.html) for complete instructions for this part of the project.

The pom file is configured to use the model Lexical Analyzer (it actually only needs TokenType). If you want to use your own Lexical Analyzer, follow the directions for the starter parser. The parser is not required for testing the symbol table routines.
